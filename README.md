This project aims to explore the relationship between ESG scores and stock prices

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors have become essential elements in evaluating the long-term sustainability and ethical practices of companies. In recent years, ESG scores have gained significant traction among investors, analysts, and policymakers due to growing concerns about environmental impact, social responsibility, and corporate governance. ESG metrics provide a way to assess how well companies manage risks related to these factors, making them increasingly relevant for investment decisions. Investors are not only looking at financial returns but also considering the broader impact of a company's activities on society and the environment. As a result, companies that perform well on ESG factors are often perceived as more sustainable and less risky, which can lead to better financial performance in the long run.
The relationship between ESG scores and stock price performance has become an important area of research, as many believe that companies with strong ESG practices are likely to outperform their peers in the stock market. In this project, I will analyze how ESG scores affect stock price performance, using two key datasets to explore this relationship:
•	World Bank Group ESG Dataset: This dataset provides a variety of global ESG indicators, including data on environmental practices, social policies, and governance standards across countries and industries. It offers a comprehensive view of how different nations and sectors are performing in terms of sustainability and corporate responsibility. This dataset will help to assess the broader ESG landscape and the relative performance of companies within it. (https://esgdata.worldbank.org/data/download?lang=en) 
•	Polygon API Stock Data: The Polygon API offers real-time and historical stock price data for a wide range of companies. By using this dataset, I can track stock price movements and performance over time, which will serve as the basis for comparing the effects of ESG scores on stock performance. The real-time and historical data will allow for an in-depth analysis of how stock prices react to changes in ESG scores.  (https://polygon.io/docs/stocks/getting-started)  

This project aims to predict the relationship between a company's ESG score and its stock price performance. Specifically, the goal is to identify whether higher ESG scores correlate with better stock performance, thus providing insights for investors who may use ESG metrics as part of their decision-making process. Additionally, my findings could be useful for policymakers looking to understand the broader financial implications of sustainable and socially responsible business practices.
Through this analysis, I hope to highlight whether companies that prioritize sustainability and ethical practices achieve better financial outcomes in the stock market. In doing so, the project will offer valuable insights into the potential financial benefits of adopting ESG-friendly policies, benefiting not only investors but also society by encouraging businesses to focus on long-term sustainable growth.
